Hi, and welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Tsinghua University. 
<br>
I am on the 2023-2024 job market for assistant faculty and post-doc positions. 
<br><br>
My research interests are decision making on bounded rationality and more generally behavioral and experimental economics, with pertinent microeconomic theories such as revealed preference and decision theory.
<br><br>
To learn more about my research, please download my <a href="https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/9699c74323bc409eb923/" download="You SHAN_CV">CV</a> or contact me directly.
