Hi, and welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Tsinghua University. 
<br><br>
My research interests are decision making on bounded rationality and more generally behavioral and experimental economics, with pertinent microeconomic theories such as revealed preference and decision theory.
<br><br>
I am on the 2023-2024 job market for assistant faculty and post-doc positions.
