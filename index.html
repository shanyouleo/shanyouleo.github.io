<p>Hi, and welcome! I joined School of Management University of Science and Technology of China, as a Tenure-Track Associate Professor. I received my Ph.D. degree in Economics from Tsinghua University on June, 2024. </p>

<p>My research interests include decision-making on <strong>bounded rationality</strong> and more generally behavioral and experimental economics, with pertinent microeconomic theories such as <strong>revealed preference</strong> and <strong>decision theory</strong>.</p>

<p>To learn more about my research, please download my <a href="https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/9699c74323bc409eb923/" download="You SHAN_CV">CV</a> or contact me directly.</p>
