Hi, and welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at the Tsinghua University. 
<br><br>
My primary research interests are deeply rooted in behavioral and experimental economics, with a particular emphasis on the concept of bounded rationality in decision-making.
<br><br>
I am especially intrigued by the potential of applying pertinent microeconomic theories, such as revealed preference and decision theory, to more realistic societal contexts, notably in the digital economy, labor markets, and the rapidly advancing field of AI decision-making.
<br><br>
I am on the 2023-2024 job market for assistant faculty and post-doc positions. To learn more about my research, please download my <a href="https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/9699c74323bc409eb923/" download="You SHAN_CV">CV</a> or contact me directly.
